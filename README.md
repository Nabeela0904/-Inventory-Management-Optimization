# -Inventory-Management-Optimization
This project focuses on optimizing inventory management using Python and SQLite for small to medium-sized businesses. Efficient inventory management ensures that stock levels are maintained properly, reducing the risk of stockouts or overstock situations. 
This system automates the tracking of inventory, alerts for low stock, and processes sales and restocking operations based on predefined conditions.
The project includes core features such as:

Stock Monitoring: Tracks current stock levels for products.
Low Stock Alerts: Automatically generates alerts when stock falls below a predefined reorder level.
Sales Processing: Updates stock levels when sales are made.
Automatic Restocking: Automatically restocks products that fall below the reorder threshold.
Inventory Overview: Provides a snapshot of the current inventory status with details on product categories, stock levels, and reorder requirements.
The system is built using Python for backend operations and SQLite for data storage. It is designed to be lightweight and easily extensible, making it a perfect solution for small businesses or personal inventory tracking.
Key Features
  Product Management: Add, update, and delete products with attributes such as product name, category, current stock, reorder level, and reorder quantity.
  Sales Tracking: Automatically update stock levels when sales occur and adjust inventory accordingly.
  Restocking Mechanism: Generate automatic restocking orders when stock levels dip below the reorder threshold.
  Low Stock Alerts: Promptly alerts the user about low-stock items that need restocking.
  Database-Driven: Leverages SQLite for storing product and inventory data, allowing easy access and scalability.
Technologies Used:
  Python: Backend logic for inventory management operations.
  SQLite: Database used to store inventory, sales, and restocking data.
  SQL Queries: Basic SQL queries to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database.  
Future Enhancements:
  Integration with a Web Interface: Build a simple web interface to view and manage inventory.
  Demand Forecasting: Add predictive analytics to forecast demand and adjust stock levels accordingly.
  Reporting System: Add more advanced reporting features for inventory and sales trends.
